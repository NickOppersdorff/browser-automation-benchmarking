# browser-automation-benchmarking
Benchmarking characteristics of popular browser automation tools such as Selenium and Playwright.

## Introduction
I see a lot of people choosing Playwright as their automation tool of choice over the defacto standard, Selenium. 
I wanted to understand why and what are the characteristics that make Playwright a better choice over Selenium. 

This repository is an attempt benchmark and compare features of both Selenium and Playwright, to better understand 
things like; performance and reliability of each tool, and to identify how one might mitigate shortcomings of one tool.
